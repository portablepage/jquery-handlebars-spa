# Simple jQuery/Handlebars/Json Single Page App
A wireframe for a simple json-powered single page app with jQuery and Handlebars.

While there are many advanced single page web-app frameworks out there, I wanted a simple, customizable jQuery wireframe to use as a starting point for Single Page Apps. The data comes from json files (locally in the 'data'-folder, or connect an external API) and you can define handlebars templates in index.html. Each post can use a different template by setting the "template" variable in the json data.
